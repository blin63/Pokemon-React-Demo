# Pokemon React Demo
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup
To start this react app, run `npm start` in the terminal of the project directory.
Then go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Project Overview
This is a simple react demo that uses the [PokeAPI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json/master/pokedex.json) to display images of pokemon from the pokedex found at the PokeAPI. The app is paginated and demonstrates the use of react to create a simple web app.

The app is built using React and Node.js.

**NOTE: This react demo app was created for a previous school assignment while learning how to create web apps using React.**
